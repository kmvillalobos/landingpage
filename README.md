## 🎨 Customization Tips

- **Branding:** Modify `src/layouts/Layout.astro` to change the CSS variables (`--primary`, `--background`) and update global SEO tags.
- **Content:** The main logic lives in `src/components/ZenApp.tsx`. You can easily add more breathing patterns or cat affirmations there.
- **Assets:** Swap out the images in `public/images/` to change the theme from cats to anything else (dogs, nature, etc.).
